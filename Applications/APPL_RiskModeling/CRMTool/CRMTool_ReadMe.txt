CRMTool (The Collective Risk Model Tool) is an Aggregate Loss 
Distribution Calculator, suggested to            
evaluate the Collective Risk Model (CRM) compound Aggregate Loss              
Distribution (ALD) and the associated Value at Risk (VaR / quantiles)         
by numerical inversion of its characteristic function (CF).                   
                                                                              
CRMTool is a part of the CharFunTool (The Characteristic Functions             
Toolbox) which consists of a set of algorithms for evaluating selected        
characteristic funcions and algorithms for numerical inversion of the         
(combined and/or compound) characteristic functions, used to evaluate the     
probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution            
function (CDF).
