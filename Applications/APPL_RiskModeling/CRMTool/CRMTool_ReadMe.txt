CRMTool:   Aggregate Loss Distribution Calculator                             
Version:   2.0. (CRMTool is integrated part of CharFunTool)

CRMTool (The Collective Risk Model Tool) is an Aggregate Loss 
Distribution Calculator, suggested to evaluate the Collective Risk Model 
(CRM) compound Aggregate Loss Distribution (ALD) and the associated 
quantiles, here frequently denoted as the Value at Risk (VaR), by numerical 
inversion of its characteristic function (CF).                   
                                                                              
CRMTool is integral part of the CharFunTool (The Characteristic Functions             
Toolbox) which consists of a set of algorithms for evaluating selected        
characteristic funcions and algorithms for numerical inversion of the         
(combined and/or compound) characteristic functions, used to evaluate the     
probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution            
function (CDF).   

EDITING of the CRMTool:
The functionality of CRMTool can be easily edited and changed by using the 
MATLAB appdesiner. For that, rename the 'CRMTool.m' file as 'CRMTool.mlapp'
and edit it by running the command 'appdesigner CRMTool'. 

Installing the CRMTool:        
CRMTool can be installed as independent MATLAB application by running the 
installer 'CRMTool.mlappinstall', which was created from the associated 
packiging project 'CRMTool.prj'.
