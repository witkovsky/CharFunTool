%%% DEVELOPER'S NOTE %%%
% The algorithm in this MATLAB script is based on the paper: 
% [1] D. Ruiz--Antoln and A. Townsend, "A nonuniform fast Fourier transform
% based on low rank approximation", in preparation, 2016. 

% This introduces quasi-optimal complexity algorithms (O(Nlog N
% log(1/eps)/loglog(1/eps)) operations) for:
% 
% The nonuniform DFT of type-I (NUDFT-I), which is equivalent to evaluating
% a Fourier series with noninteger frequencies at equispaced points,
% 
% The nonuniform DFT of type-II (NUDFT-II), which is equivalent to
% evaluating a Fourier series at nonequispaced points, (This is the default
% transform.)
% 
% The nonuniform DFT of type-III, which is equivalent to evaluating a
% Fourier series with noninteger frequencies at nonequispaced points,
% 
% Inverse transform for NUDFT-I, which is equivalent to computing
% coefficients of Fourier interpolants with noninteger frequencies from
% equispaced function samples, and
% 
% Inverse transform for NUDFT-II, which is equivalent to computing
% coefficients of Fourier interpolants from nonequispaced function samples.
% 
% This MATLAB code may nicely accompany the recent preprint "Trigonometric
% Interpolation and Quadrature in Perturbed Points" by Austin and Trefethen
% https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04018. This provides functionality in Chebfun
% for experimenting with trigonometric interpolants of periodic functions
% on [0,1] at perturbed points.
