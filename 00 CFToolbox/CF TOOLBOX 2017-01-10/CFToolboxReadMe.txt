CF TOOLBOX: The Characteristic Functions Toolbox consists
of a set of algorithms for evaluating selected characteristic funcions
and algorithms for numerical inversion of the (combined and/or compound)
characteristic functions, used to evaluate the probability density
function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF).
                                                                              
The inversion algorithms are based on using simple trapezoidal rule for
computing the integrals defined by the Gil-Pelaez formulae, and/or by
using the FFT algorithm for computing the Fourier transform integrals.
