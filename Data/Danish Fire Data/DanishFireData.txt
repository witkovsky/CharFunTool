The Danish Insurance Data (univariate)

These data were collected at Copenhagen Reinsurance and comprise 2167 fire losses over the period 1980 to 1990. They have been adjusted for inflation to reflect 1985 values and are expressed in millions of Danish Krone. Have a look at my 1997 ASTIN paper.
The Danish Insurance Data (multivariate)

These are the same data as above but the total claim has been divided into a building loss, a loss of contents and a loss of profits.
